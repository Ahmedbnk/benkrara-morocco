The 2022 World Cup in Qatar witnessed the Atlas Lions captivating the football world. Their historic triumph not only fueled Moroccan dreams but also brought the nation together, fostering shared values of joy, passion, and unity. In the intricate tale between Morocco and football, a narrative unfolds—a story marked by love and challenges, reminding us that the impossible is within reach: We dream big.

Morocco, the Kingdom of Light, has consistently illuminated the global sporting stage. Guided by the visionary leadership of His Majesty The King Mohammed VI, supported by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation's endeavors, and fueled by the people's passion, Moroccan football has consistently delivered moments of sheer happiness and breathtaking brilliance to fans of the beautiful game.

A perennial source of inspiration for African football, Morocco's achievements are etched in history:

In 1976, the Atlas Lions clinched the African Cup of Nations in Ethiopia.
In 1986, Morocco pioneered as the first African nation to advance beyond the initial round of a World Cup, though their journey was halted by the German Mannschaft.
The saga continued, and in 2013, Marrakech witnessed another milestone—the Club World Cup final between Raja of Casablanca and Bayern Munich. In a riveting match, the Rajaouis etched their names in history as the first African team to reach the final, overcoming renowned clubs like the Brazilian Atletico Mineiro featuring the legendary Ronaldinho.

Fast forward to 2022, and the Moroccan national team, under the guidance of Coach Walid Regragui, scripted history. They became the first African nation to reach the World Cup semi-finals, earning a spot in the "Golden Square" of this grand sporting event.

Moroccan football's brilliance extends across various arenas. The Futsal team's triumph in the intercontinental tournament in Thailand in 2022 elevated them to the 8th position globally. Their impressive record includes two African Championships (2016, 2020) and two Arab Nations Championships (2021, 2022). The beach soccer team reached the semi-finals of the African Cup of Nations, and in 2022, the Atlas Lionesses were crowned African vice-champions, securing their passage to the 2023 World Cup in Australia.

Moroccan clubs boast the most successful track record on the continent. Wydad Athletic Club (WAC) secured several titles, including the African Champions Cup (1992, 2017, 2022) and the African Super Cup (2018). As African Champions, WAC celebrated their second participation in the Club World Cup 2023, hosted in Morocco.

The echoes of success from Raja Club Athletic (RCA) reverberate across Africa. The Green Eagles clinched titles such as the African Super Cup (2000), the African Champions Cup (1989, 1997, 1999), and the Arab Champions League (2006).

The Moroccan fans at the 2022 World Cup played a pivotal role, earning the title of the "TWELFTH MAN" behind the Atlas Lions.

The Renaissance Sportive of Berkane (RSB), a historic club from the Oriental region, continues to multiply its exploits. In 2020, the club secured the African Football Confederation Cup and repeated the feat in 2022. In the same year, they were crowned winners of the African Super Cup.

These achievements are the fruits of long-term efforts led by the Royal Moroccan Football Federation (FRMF), investing in infrastructure, equipment, and training centers—nurturing grounds for champions and heroes capable of facing challenges and making the dreams of the Moroccan people a reality.
