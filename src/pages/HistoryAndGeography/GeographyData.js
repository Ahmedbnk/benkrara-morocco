  //       The Anti-Atlas, which is a chain recognized by its excessive aridity, hosts modest summits with Jbel Siroua (3 300 m) being the highest peak.
  //       Like the High Atlas and the Middle Atlas, all its massifs has an astonishing diversity  in terms of fauna and flora, geology and culture with Amazigh charm. Its arid character is due to its proximity to the Saharan lands since its last rampart is just before the "Hamada du DraÃ¢".
  //       Previously unknown, the crossing of the Anti-Atlas mountains represents today a modern circuit, rich in landscapes and leisure activities.

    The High Atlas, commonly known as the "roof of Morocco", is home to the highest peak in North Africa (Djbel Toubkal with 4,167 meters high). Stretching over 750 kilometres in length, the massifs of the High Atlas separate three parts of Morocco: Atlantic Morocco, Mediterranean Morocco and Saharan Morocco. With its Amazigh and Berber character, its inhabitants practise livestock farming and agriculture, which also represent the main economic pillars of the High Atlas. Apart from its tourist attractiveness, the High Atlas is known internationally not only for its national park for the preservation of natural biodiversity, but also for its archaeological sites.`,

    The Middle Atlas, which is touristic, offers a diversity of landscapes. Rich in fauna and flora, it presents a colourful picture of lakes, forests of holm oaks, cork oaks and deserted volcanic plateaus. Spread over 350 kilometres, the massifs of the Middle Atlas cover several regions of Morocco: Ifrane, Khenifra, Sefrou, Boulmane, Midelt, Hajeb, Taza and Beni-mellal. Moreover, these massifs belong to four water basins: the Sebou basin, the Bouregreg basin, the Oum Errabiaa basin and the Moulouya basin. The first three water basins flow into the Atlantic and the last one into the Mediterranean. `,
