                    The Idrisside dynasty was the first to conquer Morocco for

                    the Idrisside dynasty dominated much of the Maghreb,
                    including the North Africa of the current Morocco. Being the

                    Idrissides were able to build new cities including Fez,

                    the reign of the son Idriss II and his successors. Several
                    monuments are evidence of the architectural and religious
                    works of this dynasty, such as the Al-Qarawiyin Mosque,

                  was rejuvenated, embellishing the whole city and creating
