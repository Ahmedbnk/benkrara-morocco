  //   The Idrisside dynasty, pioneers in conquering Morocco for over a century, established their dominance with Idriss I, renowned for designating Volubilis (Walili) as the capital. Spanning from 789 to 978, the Idrissides wielded influence across much of the Maghreb, encompassing present-day North Africa, particularly Morocco. As the inaugural royal dynasty in the region, they laid the foundation for new urban centers, most notably Fez, which later supplanted Volubilis as the capital during the rule of Idriss II and subsequent successors. The enduring legacy of the Idrissides is evident in various architectural and religious landmarks, exemplified by the Al-Qarawiyin Mosque, a significant masterpiece. Despite years of reign, the dynasty eventually succumbed to the Almoravids. //     `,

    The Almoravid dynasty emerged as the successor to the Idrissides, exerting influence over the Maghreb. Prioritizing the destruction of the African reign before venturing northward, they established Marrakech in 1062, ultimately reigning over the entire Maghreb and Al-Andalus. Marrakech, chosen as their capital, flourished into a pivotal trade center bridging sub-Saharan Africa and the Maghreb. Noteworthy architectural and religious contributions include the Koutoubia mosque, Koranic medersas, ramparts, palaces, and an irrigation center providing water for the region.`,

    paragraphe: `
    The Almohad architectural style, characterized by its intricate details, not only blends innovation with tradition but also serves as a living testament to the sophisticated artistic vision of the era. Marrakech, shaped by the cultural richness nurtured during the Almohad rule, stands as a dynamic city where vibrant traditions, artistic expressions, and societal norms seamlessly intertwine. Even in the aftermath of the dynasty's decline, the enduring echoes of its impact persist, weaving a nuanced narrative into the very fabric of Marrakech's historical and cultural tapestry.

The Merinid dynasty, with Fez as its capital, not only overthrew the Almohads but also faced a complex geopolitical landscape, particularly contending with the Portuguese through strategic attacks on Ceuta and the Strait of Gibraltar. In their pursuit of transmitting religious values, the Merinids left an enduring legacy of enlightenment, evident in the establishment of Zaouias, mosques, and Koranic medersas, notably exemplified by the remarkable institution in Salé. Beyond architectural and religious endeavors, the necropolis of Chellah in Rabat serves as a poignant reminder of the Merinids' multifaceted impact, encompassing cultural, historical, and architectural dimensions.`,

    paragraphe: `
    Having ousted the Merinids, the Saadian dynasty initially made Fez their capital before conquering Marrakech. Engaging in warfare against the Portuguese, they reclaimed cities, including Agadir, and formed an alliance with Spain to ward off Turkish threats. The Saadians ushered in a period of glory marked by cultural, intellectual, and economic prosperity. Their victories, including the acquisition of gold from Sudan after defeating the Songhai Empire, led to the construction of significant artistic artifacts in Fez and Marrakech, such as the Borjs, Al Qarawiyine mosque, Saadian Tombs, Ben Youssef medersa, and the El Badiî Palace.

  //       The Saadians were dethroned by the Alaouite dynasty. Originating from Tafilalt, the Alaouite dynasty drove out the Saadians for the sake of power. After taking Fez as a capital, it was up to Meknes under the reign of Sultan Moulay Ismail, then finally to Rabat, which has been the current capital of Morocco since 1912. Thanks to this dynasty, the city of Fez was rejuvenated, embellishing the whole city and creating protective walls such as the famous Bab El-Mansour gate. The dynasty continued its reign until today. Muhammad VI is the twenty-third ruler of this succession, ensuring the unification of the Kingdom and the transmission of all religious values.
